        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <h4>
            <p>
                I earned the rank of Eagle Scout with the Boy Scouts of America. I Served as a<br/> 
                missionary for the LDS church in 2016 for 2 years in Ohio.<br/>
                I Love being at the skatepark learning new tricks and spending time with friends.<br/>
                Thanks to my Father, I have loved video games my whole life, especially survival<br/>
                and strategy games. I want to live in the Japan countryside someday as a fluent <br/>
                speaker of Japanese - which all started when a certain friend introduced me to Anime<br/>
                during covid. <br />
                I also have a YouTube channel with videos from Japan! - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@janderman1041">My YouTube Channel</a>
